# NAME

App::test::travis - Runs Travis-CI scripts (.travis.yml)

# USAGE

    test-travis [--dry-run] [.travis.yml]

# DESCRIPTION

`test-travis(1)` is a helper script which runs scripts defined in `.travis.yml`, emulating Travis-CI environments.

Note that the actual Travis-CI runs projects on Linux, so Linux specific commands like `apt-get(1)` won't work.
